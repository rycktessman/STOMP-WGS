Bioinformatic pipeline scripts from "Tuberculosis Molecular Epidemiology from Mass Screening of a Densely Populated Ugandan Community"

Main scripts are the the "main_bash_scripts" folder. These are labeled in the order they should be run.
Some scripts make use of helper R or python scripts, which are included in the "helper_python_R_scripts" folder.
Many of the helper scripts are adapted from existing scripts, and author credits are included in the scripts.
